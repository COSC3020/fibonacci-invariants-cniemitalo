# Fibonacci Invariants

Recall the definition of the Fibonacci series: the first number is 0, the second
1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two numbers preceding it.
Implement a function that computes the Fibonacci numbers recursively, storing
the results in an array.

For example, the return value of `fib(7)` is the following array:

| index |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value |  0  |  1  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  5  |  8  |  13 |

Add your code in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided some basic
testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

## Invariant

What is a good invariant for your recursive implementation of `fib()`
i.e. something that is always true at the beginning of the recursive call?

Hint: Think about what the "state of the world" is here and what you can say
about it at the start of each recursive call. Your invariant must say something
about the current recursive call.

Describe your reasoning and the conclusion you've come to. Your reasoning is the
most important part. You do not need to prove that the invariant is correct. Add
your answer to this markdown file.

My answer: 

I think a good invariant for this recursive fibonacci function would be: at the beginning of every recursive call, the function is calculating n = (n - 1) + (n - 2) with fibonacci[0] = 0 and fibonacci[1] = 1. This requires that the array will hold the accurate previous values up to a - 1. As each element in the array is the sum of the two from before, beginning with the first two, 0 and 1, which are their own values. This pattern is repeated through each recursive statement, so it will always hold true no matter what value of n you are calculating, or what cycle of recursion the program is on. Each element will be the sum of the two before it, after the first two elements are the value of themselves.
